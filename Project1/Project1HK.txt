Computational Astrophysics Project 1 Investigation of Lutz-Kelker bias, through
Monte Carlo simulations, on estimation of
stellar distance using trigonometric parallax
Howard Kinsman
February 25, 2016
Abstract
Monte Carlo simulations were carried out with a randomly generated sample of 400,000 stars and derived absolute magnitudes and
distances were retrieved from the sample with assumed parallax and
photometric errors. The resulting derived data were compared with
the ’true’ data and the error dispersion was found to be consistent
with the well known Lutz-Kelker bias.

Introduction

The Lutz-Kelker bias was ﬁrst quantiﬁed (Lutz and Kelker, 1973) using the
absolute magnitude of stars estimated with trigonometric parallax. It occurs
because the number of observable stars increases with the square of the distance. For any given parallax measurement there will be an error which will
give an upper and lower bound of retrieved distance, and stars at a smaller
distance and stars further away can scatter into this volume, however as there
are more stars outside the sampled volume than inside, the sample will be
biased. This eﬀect causes a systematic bias such that measured parallaxes
will on average yield too small distances (Oudmaijer et al., 1997). Monte
Carlo simulations are ideally placed to investigate this phenomenom and
provide corrections and the necessary calibration to trigonometric parallax
measurements.

Monte Carlo simulations

Four Monte Carlo simulations were carried out, each with a sample of 400,000
stars having a true absolute magnitude of 0.6 (with a Gaussian dispersion
of 0.001 mag.). The stars were assigned true distances of between 1pc and
8Kpc. A small σ photometric error of 0.01 mag. in the measurement of the
retrieved absolute magnitude was assumed in each case. Please note that the
original LKbiasMSc.f program had a small bug associated with photometric
error - this was corrected prior to running these simulations. Only stars
within a retrieved distance of 4Kpc were considered.

2.1

Task 1

For this simulation a constant spatial density distribution of stars was assumed. This simulation employed a constant parallax error of 50 microarcsec.
There was no apparent magnitude limit. The total mean and standard deviation of the retrieved absolute magnitudes are shown in Table 1 together with
the mean and standard deviations after the results were split into 1000pc
bins. This is shown graphically in Figures 1 to 4. A scatter plot of retrieved
absolute magnitude as a function of retrieved distance is shown in Figure 5.
Figures 6 and 7 show the number distribution of stars for true and retrieved
distance respectively.

Discussion

The mean of the total sample, 1.0355 as shown in Table 1, has clearly diverged
from the true mean absolute magnitude of 0.6. With a dispersion (standard
deviation) of 0.4797 it is not a true representive of the sample: there is a
bias. Table 1 and Figures 1 to 4 from the Task 1 simulation show that the
margin of error in retrieved absolute magnitude grows with the retrieved
distance. Stars within 2Kpc are showing a mean absolute magnitude that is
approximately 0.6 but for more distant stars the standard deviation grows
sharply with distance. The scatter plot in Figure 5 illustrates this further
with a strong tendency towards larger (less bright) absolute magnitudes with
greater distance.
Figures 6 and 7 help explain the above error margin by showing that the
number distribution of stars selected by retrieved distance is far greater than
those selected by true distance. This is consistent with the Lutz-Kelker bias:
the retrieved distances are seen to be smaller than they acually are, causing
a greater number of more distant stars to be pulled into the sample than
nearby stars, creating a bias.
In addition to the Lutz-Kelker bias another form of bias needs to be
taken into account and that is caused by error propogation. In this case as
R = 1/p (R=distance, p=parallax) there is an inverse relationship between
the measurement (parallax) and the derived quantity (distance) which leads
to an asymmetric error i.e. the error will become greater the more distant
the star.
In Task 2 an apparent magnitude limit of 14 was assumed. This simulation resulted in a much improved total mean absolute magnitude and
lower error dispersions in the various bins in Table 2 and Figures 8 to 11.
This can be attributed to the number distribution of stars sampled for true
and retrieved distances, as can be seen in Figures 13 and 14 the number of
stars in both ﬁgures are similar. Lutz determined that in a magnitude limited sample the Lutz-Kelker corrections should not be applied (Lutz, 1983).
There is however a bias still associated with a magnitude limited sample:
the Malmquist bias, which is the preferential selection of intrinsically bright
objects.
Task 3 assumed a stellar spatial density decreasing by R−2 whereas the
previous simulations all assumed a constant spatial density. The results,
Table 3 and Figures 15 to 21 again show a reduction in the error. So it
seems that an exponentially declining spatial stellar density does go some
way to counteract the Lutz-Kelker bias. The Milky Way is disk shaped so
is clearly not uniform in structure and some Kutz-Kelker calibrations do
attempt to take scale height, direction and large scale structure into account
19

(Smith, 1999). There is an exponential decrease of projected density with
galactocentric radius for spiral galaxies (Smith, 1999).
Finally, Task 4 introduced a Gaia-like error approximation, together with
the apparent magnitude limit of 14 from Task 2. This simulation produced
results with very low margins of error, see Table 4 and Figures 22 to 28, even
at large distances. Lutz-Kelker corrections and calibration therefore can, and
should, be taken into account when estimating distance with trigonometric
parallax. However, as can be seen from the Gaia-like error corrections, these
calibrations themselves also need revision as technological improvements increase the accuracy of parallax measurements.
