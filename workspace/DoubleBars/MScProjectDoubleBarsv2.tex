\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Double-Barred Galaxies} 
Double-barred galaxies, where a smaller inner bar is nested inside a larger outer bar, were first observed in 1975 by de Vaucouleurs \citep{vaucouleurs}, however it was only in the 1990s that double-barred galaxies
were recognised as being a distinct category of galaxies. The current estimates of double-barred galaxy frequencies are $\approx30\%$ of barred galaxies and $\approx20\%$ of all galaxies \citep{erwin3}.
\cite{erwin2} surveyed 38 barred galaxies and found a total of 10 double-barred galaxies with no preference for Hubble type. They found that inner bars were about 12\% the size of the outer bars with
semi-major axes from $\approx250$pc to 1 kpc. Secondary bars probably rotate independently of, but in the same direction as their associated primary bars \cite{erwin2}.
\cite{erwin1} believe that innder bars probably rotate independently of their outer bars and suggest that they are relatively long-lived strucutures.
Inner bar size has been found to correlate slightly with outer bar size \citep{erwin3}. The median size ratio is $\approx0.12$ with an upper limit of $\approx0.25$ which is consistent with the theory that
inner bars cannot be too large without disrupting the orbit of the outer bar.

It has been suggested that nested bars may provide a mechanism for fueling active galactic nuclei \citep{shlosman} however more recently \citep{erwin3} believe that inner bars only play a minor role in this 
activity. \citep{erwin1} compared single and double-barred galaxies and found that there was no significant difference in nuclear activity. To investigate this theory further \cite{lorenzo1} carried out a 
study of NGC 357. This study aimed to present the first detailed morphological, kinematical and stellar population analysis of the bulge, inner and outer bars of a double-barred galaxy. They concluded that
the bulge and inner bar show similar stellar population properties whilst the outer bar was less metal-rich. This result implied that, for the case of NGC 357, the outer bar was formed in a shorter timescale than
the inner structures and so disagrees with traditional idea that gas flown along the outer structure triggers star formation causing the formation of the inner structure. This was strengthened by a further study of
four double-barred galaxies by \cite{lorenzo2} where they concluded that the stellar populations of inner bars are younger and more metal-rich than the outer bars. This suggests that at present inner bars play a
moderate or even minor role in the morphological evolution of double-barred galaxies \citep{lorenzo2}.

Through the use of computer modeeling \cite{saha} showed that double bars can form without gas in a dark matter dominated halo. They produced a model where the inner bar was rotating at almost as slowly as the 
outer bar. The route to the formation of double bars maybe very different to that of a single bar.

\subsection{N-Body Simulations and the Four-Body Problem}
Studies of three or more bodies interacting gravitationally dates back to the time of Newton. However it is only with the widespread use of computers that orbits of more than three bodies have been extensively studied. Today
N-body simulations are an essential tool in the study of solar system dynamics and galactic dynamics. The orbit-integration problems we have to address
vary in complexity from following a single particle in a given, smooth galactic potential, to tens of thousands of interacting stars in a globular cluster, to billions of dark-matter particles in a 
simulation of cosmological clustering \citep{binney}. Celestial mechanics during the preceding centuries has mainly focussed on the three body problem
due to the complexities involved in adding more bodies. It is estimated that within the Milky Way approximately two thirds of all stars exist in binary systems and a further one fifth of these are in triple systems whilst a
further fifth still exist in systems with more than three bodies \citep{steves}. \cite{steves} estimate that $\approx2\times10^9$ quadruple systems exist in the Milky Way galaxy. They found that quadruple systems exist in two
forms: a double binary or linear.

The classical equations of motion for an N-body problem are:
\begin{equation}
m_i\mathbf{\ddot{r}}=\sum_{i\neq{j}}\frac{{m_i}{m_j}}{r^3_{ij}}\mathbf{r_{ij}}
\qquad
i=1,2,3...
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{r_i}=\left(x_i,y_i\right)$ and $\mathbf{r_{ij}}=\mathbf{r_j}-\mathbf{r_i}$. 
The units have been selected so that the gravitational constant (G) is equal to one. In simulations it is natural to choose units where G = 1 and the units of length nand mass are conventionally chosen
so that the total mass of the system is M = 1 \citep{heggie}.

The four body problem, specifically, has been studied extensively by \cite{steves}. Here they model four equal mass bodies orbiting in circular coplanar orbits. This model they term the Caledonian problem, because
their research is being carried out at Glasgow Caledonian University.
Approximately a century ago the Copenhagen problem was studied extensively in Copenhagen which consisted of a three body problem: two equal mass bodies and an infinitesimally small test particle. \cite{szell} also
studied the Caledonian problem and found that the stability of the system is dependent upon a constant termed the Szebehely constant. The Caledonian Symmetric Double Binary Problem (CSDBP) is relevant in 
studying the stability and evolution of symmetric quadruple stellar clusters and exoplanetary systems of two planets orbiting a binary pair of stars \citep{alvarez}.

Methods for the study of N-body simulations have changed considerably since the advent of computers. In a study of N-body simulations \cite{trenti} mentions a pioneering attempt by Holmberg in 1941 which used 
light bulbs and galvanometers to track the evolution of 37 particles. However it wasn't until the early seventies and the advent of computers that this field really got started. 
Nowadays simulations can up to a million particles \citep{heggie} which is of particular relevance to the study of globular
clusters. I refer the reader to \cite{aarseth} for much more detailed explanation of the field of N-body simulations.

\subsection{Orbits, Loops, Resonances and Double-Barred Galaxy Simulations}
Double-barred galaxy simulations and models have taken many forms. \cite{du1} explored the formation and evolution of double-barred galaxies (which is not very well understood) by showing that a dynamically
cool inner disk embedded in a hotter outer disk can generate a secondary bar while the outer disk forms a large-scale primary bar. \cite{macie8} used hydrodynamical simulations to study gas inflow in barred galaxies
and the effect this has on secondary bars. They concluded that the secondary bar can prevent, rather than enhance, the inflow. More recently, \cite{debattista} used collisionless N-body simulations to show
that inner bars can form spontaneously without requiring gas. They also found that secondary bars rotate faster that primary bars and that the secondary bars pulsate. This is considered further in the Discussion.

In an attempt to explain the dynamics of the orbits of nested bars \cite{macie7} introduced the concept of `loops'. They wanted to investigate how two independently rotating bars can maintain
themselves as gravitating systems. A gravitational potential consisting of two concentric bisymmetric bars that are independently rotating is not stationary in any reference frame \cite{macie7}. In the potential
of a single bar particles would stay on a stable closed periodic orbit but with nested bars orbits will not be closed because the particles would be experience two separate forces. The `loop' therefore was
introduced as an extension of the concept of orbit. Particles in a `loop' would return to their original positions every time the bars come back to the same relative orientation \citep{macie7}. This lead to
the conclusion that loops supporting the inner bar are thicker with parallel bars and thinner with perpendicular bars \citep{macie3}. This also suggets that the two bars do not rotate through each other as rigid bodies
but the inner bar should pulsate and that the bars should spend more time nearly orthognal\citep{macie3}. These predictions were confirmed by \citep{debattista} and \citep{shen1}. 
This was further confirmed by \cite{macie5} who found
that the inner bar should end well within its corotation radius and that the inner bar extends further out for lower pattern speeds than higher ones; the inner bar pulsates; and that the angular velocity of the inner
bar is not uniform and that faster inner bars rotate more coherently.

\cite{wozniak} also carried out double-barred galaxy simulations and achieved long-lived inner bars lasting for up to 7 Gyr. These were N-body/hydrodynamical simulations. They found that the two bar lengths, ratio of
pattern speeds, as well as the age of the inner stellar bar populations in the simulations matched well with observations. They concluded that because, unlike previous simulations, there was no overlap between primary bar 
inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and the inner bar corotation (CR) or any kind of resonance overlap, then some other kind of mechanism must feed the central waves \citep{wozniak}. It is suggested that star 
formation may be responsible for bringing energy into the inner bar.

\cite{garzon} studied the dynamical evolution of two isolated bars, within the same galaxy, under their mutual gravitational interaction. They considered two cases purely analytically: rotation of rigid bodies and
rotation of deformable rotation. They found that the bars oscillate in size according to the relative angle between the bars. This is broadly in agreement with \citep{debattista}.
What follows is an attempt to verify the calculations in \citep{garzon} but using a simpler model of a double-barred galaxy using a double binary.

\section{Methods}
The model was created using OdeInt from Numerical Recipes \citep{press}. OdeInt was first converted to Fortran 90 for this purpose.
Fortran 90 was selected as the language of choice in order to avoid the fixed line limitations of Fortran 77.
OdeInt performs integration using the Runge-Kutta method. The Runge-Kutta method is an extension of the Euler method of solving differential equations. However the Euler method
is an example of first-order integration whilst Runge-Kutta is second and higher order and so is mcuh more accurate. The OdeInt uses a subroutine called RK4 which utilises fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration.
It also uses a technique known as adaptive stepsize. This involves adjusting the size of the integration steps to ensure the same level of accuracy however rapidly the function being integrated changes.
Many small steps should tiptoe through treacherous terrain, while a few great strides should speed through smooth uninteresting countryside \citep{press}.

For a four body problem, Equation 1 results in the following:
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\mathbf{r_1}}=\frac{m_2\mathbf{r}_{12}}{r^3_{12}}+\frac{m_3\mathbf{r}_{13}}{r^3_{13}}+\frac{m_4\mathbf{r}_{14}}{r^3_{14}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\mathbf{r_2}}=\frac{m_1\mathbf{r}_{21}}{r^3_{21}}+\frac{m_3\mathbf{r}_{23}}{r^3_{23}}+\frac{m_4\mathbf{r}_{24}}{r^3_{24}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\mathbf{r_3}}=\frac{m_1\mathbf{r}_{31}}{r^3_{31}}+\frac{m_2\mathbf{r}_{32}}{r^3_{32}}+\frac{m_4\mathbf{r}_{34}}{r^3_{34}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\mathbf{r_4}}=\frac{m_1\mathbf{r}_{41}}{r^3_{41}}+\frac{m_2\mathbf{r}_{42}}{r^3_{42}}+\frac{m_3\mathbf{r}_{43}}{r^3_{43}}
\end{equation}
These equations of motion are second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) but any second-oder ODE can be written as a system
of two coupled first-order ODEs. As there are four bodies in the system, and they all have x and y positional components, this gives eight second-order 
ODEs which leaves us with a total of sixteen simultanious first-order ODEs to solve.
These equations were encoded into Fortran. 
A full code listing is supplied in a separate file.
\subsection{Initial Conditions}
As a starting point both the outer binary and inner binary were placed in circular orbits and tested separately and then combined to ensure a stable
starting point. The inner binary had an initial neglible mass.
The outer binary initial conditions were:
\begin{lstlisting}
m1=.5, m2=.5, x1=-.5, x2=.5, y1=0, y2=0,
vx1=0, vx2=0, vy1=-.5, vy2=.5
\end{lstlisting}
and for the inner binary:
\begin{lstlisting}
m3=.001, m4=.001, x3=-.001, x4=.001, y3=0, y4=0, 
vx3=0, vx4=0, vy3=-.5, vy4=.5
\end{lstlisting}
Plots of the two initial binaries are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:outerbinary} and 
\ref{fig:innerbinary}. The velocity of the inner binary is high and therefore few points are seen in this initial plot.

\label{fig:innerbinary}
\end{figure}
I then proceeded to perturb the system by gradually increasing the mass of the inner binary. As the system became unstable I componensated for
the increasing mass of the inner binary by increasing the velocity of the outer binary and also decreasing the velocity and increasing the binary 
separation of the inner binary. In many of the configurations the systems were inherently unstable and produced collisions with some 
or all of the bodies being ejected from the system. These were rejected and only `stable' configurations were considered.
Table \ref{tab:variables} shows the perturbations made to the system - only the variables in this table changed and all the other initial
conditions remained the same.

\section{Results}
As can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:config1} even a neglible mass inner binary causes the outer binary to begin to separate and become less tightly bound.
Figures Fig. \ref{fig:config1} to \ref{fig:config32i} show plots of the double binary using the parameters given in Table \ref{tab:variables}.
In many cases the inner binary is only visible as a point at the centre of the outer binary.
As the mass of the inner binary increased the system became increasingly unstable and the effect on the outer binary became more pronounced.
Even the `stable' configurations listed in Table \ref{tab:variables} hold for only a few orbits.

\ref{fig:config2} to \ref{fig:config3i} show plots where just the mass of the inner binary has been gradually increased. Nothing else was changed.
By \ref{fig:config3i}, the inner binary can clearly be seen to be pulled apart by the gravitational affect of the outer binary.

To counteract the effect of the increased mass of the inner binary in \ref{fig:config4} and \ref{fig:config4i} the initial separation of the 
inner binary has been increased.

In \ref{fig:config5} to \ref{fig:config10i} the initial velocity of the outer binary has also been gradually increased to also counteract the effect
of the increased mass of the inner binary. In order for these systems to be relatively stable the initial velocity of the inner binary was reduced. At this point 
both the inner and outer binaries had started to separate and become increasingly elliptical.

In order to bring the orbits back into approximate circularity it was necessary to again increase the velocity of the inner binary. This is illustrated
in \ref{fig:config11} and \ref{fig:config11i}. The mass of the inner binary has also increased considerably from the previous configurations.

With the mass of the inner binary now a quite considerable .1, the system showed more signs of stability if the velocity of the inner binary was further reduced, Figs. \ref{fig:config22} to \ref{fig:config25i}.

In Figs. \ref{fig:config26} to \ref{fig:config29i} the mass of the inner binary was increased to .12, and various adjustments made to inner separation, velocity and outer velocity to maintain stability.

\caption{Configuration 30 - Inner Bar}
\label{fig:config30i}
\end{figure}

Having increased the mass of the inner binary to .12 on the previous three plots it was decided, that as inner bars are generally $\approx12\%$ of the mass of the outer bar, the mass of the inner binary could stay at .1
as this is 20\% of the mass of the outer binary, Figs. \ref{fig:config30} and \ref{fig:config30i}.

\end{figure}

Finally, Figs. \ref{fig:config31} to \ref{fig:config32i} show the mass of the inner binary held at .1, but with minor adjustments made to the inner binary separation to enhance stability.
The final plot was very stable and allowed the simulation to run for far longer than all the other runs. This may be a resonance, please see Discussion. Although this final system was
very stable, even minor deviations from the initial conditions immediately resulted in destabilisation of the system, and chaos.

\newpage
\section{Disussion}
The final three runs (configurations 30, 31, and 32) were by far the most stable. The orbital periods vary slightly with time so it is difficult to give accurate figures, so
I am using the periods of the first orbit. The following table shows the periods of the two binaries together with the ratios of the corresponding periods.
\begin{table}[ht!]
  \centering
  \caption{Periods}
  \label{tab:periods}
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
   Config. & Inner & Outer & Ratio & Length of simulation\\
    \hline
   30 & .51 & 11.56 & 1:22.7 & 25\\
   31 & .54 & 11.5 & 1:21.3 & 25\\
   32 & .55 & 11.5 & 1:20.9 & 35\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Discuss mass of inner bar ratio of outer bar
The data shows that as the periodic ratios tends towards 1:21 the system considerably stabilises. Run 32 was by far the most stable run and the orbits persisted until the integrator
errored with a 'Step size underflow'. 1:21 could possibly be an orbital resonance.
%Fourier analysis?
%Rewrite in Python, automate, introduce machine laerning algoriythm 

\subsection{Future Work}
As this system has a multi-dimensional parameter space, finding stable configurations was very time consuming. I suggest further studies in this area try to automate this process.
It may be possible for an automated process to automatically reject systems in which there are collisions, or if any of the bodies exits the system, or if the system fails 
to persist for a certain number of orbits.
